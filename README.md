## What to do for v2 hmm

* the plugin config(s) to be moved to root `/` not `/plugins/ultravanilla`
    * `/ultravanilla.json` perhaps
    * alternatively `/ultravanilla/config.json` etc

* better commands api
* better chat system (or worse, up 2 u)
* better strings storage
    * something like `/strings/commands/home.json` (or maybe not json? what should we use.. maybe yaml after all!)
* more event listeners
* titles (like roles but cosmetic)
* fewer dependencies or more optimized (like instead of vault just use luckperms)
* maybe even make our own perms manager, doesn't have to be all that complex
* reload the plugin! or make one that reloads plugins..., anyways, switching the jars and reloading the plugin is quite
  ideal instead of restarting the server
